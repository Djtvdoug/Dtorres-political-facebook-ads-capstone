Analysis of political ads on Facebook.
Douglas Torres Capstone proposal

Executive Summary
This section provides an overview to the project. It should briefly touch on the motivation, data question, data to be used, along with any known assumptions and challenges.
Motivation
Social media is been found to influence the discourse on political issues over the last decade so I will be looking into data from political ads in Facebook to determine what makes a political ad successful on the platform.

Known Issues and Challenges
Explain any anticipated challenges with your project, and your plan for managing them.
Something I will have to address when presenting information for this project is my personal bias. As someone who mainly subscribes to left-from-center politics (from the American perspective), I will have to make a conscious effort to present the data as it is revealed regardless of my worldview. 

Data cleaning will have to address converting the data to appropriate datetime formats and such for proper analysis. The created_at and updated_at values are not date values for example.

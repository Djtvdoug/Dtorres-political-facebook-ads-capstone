Analysis of political ads on Facebook.
Douglas Torres Capstone proposal

**Executive Summary**

I will be looking into data from political ads in Facebook to determine what makes a political ad successful on the platform. I gathered public data from ProPublica compiled from thousands of ProPublica users from around the world, and data from Data is Plural that takes a look at posts by hyperpartisan Facebook pages.

**Motivation**

Social media is been found to influence the discourse on political issues over the last decade. My aim with this capstone project is to shed some light on which organizations are trying to influence public sentiment the most through Facebook and how reliable the information tends to be. 

**Data Question**

What makes a successful political ad on Facebook?

**Data Sources**

Article on how political ads online have affected political discourse 
https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/mar/19/facebook-political-ads-social-media-history-online-democracy

Facebook political ads database: https://www.propublica.org/datastore/dataset/political-advertisements-from-facebook

Data is Plural source: https://tinyletter.com/data-is-plural/letters/data-is-plural-2016-11-16-edition

**Approach**

By looking at the targetedness, campaigners, segmentations, and the entities mentioned in the ads I will be able to draw insights from this data to find out the ways organizations on Facebook effectively target Facebook users. 

**Obstacles observed**

Data cleaning will have to address converting the data to appropriate datetime formats and such for proper analysis. The created_at and updated_at values were not converted into proper datetime values and the ad impressions still appears as numeric continous data as supposed to categorical.
